# This file ensures the sandbox directory is tracked by git
# while ignoring all other contents in this directory
#
# The sandbox/ directory serves as a secure working area for the AI assistant:
# - Directory structure is version controlled
# - All file contents are ignored (.gitignore: sandbox/*)
# - Provides isolated file system access for tool operations
# - Safe for file creation, modification, and execution
